# Document Retrieval System

## **Project Overview**

This project delves into the enhancement of document retrieval systems through query expansion techniques. The primary goal is to improve the hit rate of document retrieval in databases, addressing the challenge of term mismatches and augmenting the context understanding of queries.

## **Abstract**

The focus of the project is to overcome the limitations of traditional information retrieval systems that often fail to consider the semantics of documents, leading to term mismatches and suboptimal performance. By leveraging query expansion—one of the most renowned pre-processing techniques in information retrieval—the project aims to improve the retrieval of relevant documents from extensive databases. The use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and Word2Vec embedding models plays a pivotal role in refining queries and augmenting document ranking.

## **Introduction**

Information retrieval systems are critical for accessing stored information, but they often struggle with understanding user queries. This project proposes a system that can enhance the relevance of document retrieval by incorporating linguistic phenomena such as synonymy and polysemy.

## **Methodology**

The methodology involves four main phases: data preprocessing, model training, query expansion, and document ranking. The project leverages the BM25 algorithm for its base retrieval model and explores various query expansion techniques utilizing NLP tools and Word2Vec embeddings.

## **Conclusion**

The project establishes a robust framework for document retrieval by integrating advanced NLP techniques, which significantly increase the accuracy of document retrieval systems. Future work may explore further integration with web applications and database systems to create a more comprehensive solution.
